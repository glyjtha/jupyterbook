# HPC Account Request Guide

## Request HPC Account

Go to https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/its/SitePages/HPC-AccountRequest.aspx and fill out the form.

## Access Requirements

To access the HPC account, you must either be connected to the TSRI Wi-Fi network or be connected to the Scripps VPN.

### TSRI Wi-Fi

- **Username:** your Scripps username (Scripps email address without '@scripps.edu')
- **Password:** your normal Scripps login credentials (password to your email)

### Scripps VPN

Go to https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/its/SitePages/VPN-PolicyAccountRequest.aspx and fill out the form.

**Important Notes:**

- If you are a UCSD student, you likely already have or can get access to the UCSD VPN which will give you access to many journals. For this reason if you already have a UCSD-affiliated VPN or can get one I do not recommend requesting a VPN account that has journal access since it slows things down.

- To change whether your VPN account has access to journals, email cahelpdesk@scripps.edu
